    %  PURPOSE: investigate what people look at whne feedback phases get so
    %  short that they contain only 1, 2 or 3 fixations. 
 
    
    %  INPUT: 
    
%         experiment: experiment name

%         summaryTable: binned data table (loaded from directory in master.m)

%         fixlvl: fixation level table for relevant experiment.

    
    %  OUTPUT: 3x1 matrix of fixations counts. relevance(1) = relevant
    %  stimulus features, relevance(2) = irrelevant stimulus features,
    %  relevance(3) = feedback buttons.

    
    %  Additional Scripts Used: []
    
    
    %  Additional Comments: this is the quarantine version aka I had to
    %  load a .mat version of the fixation level table. normally we would
    %  call from SQL directly. likely will change back to this once we can
    %  get back in the lab.

    % stands for fixation count: phase 4
    shortTrials = summaryTable(summaryTable.fc4 < 4, :);   
    subjects = unique(shortTrials.Subject);
    
    % fixations will be a list of all the fixations in the experiment
    % occurring during short feedback phases
    fixations = [];
    
    % loop through each subject
    for i = 1:length(subjects)
        
        % this gives us trial ID of all trials with a short enough fb
        % phase for the current subject
        trials = shortTrials.Trial(shortTrials.Subject == subjects(i));
        
        % this gives us all fixations for the current subject
        subjectFixations = fixlvl(fixlvl.Subject == subjects(i), :);
        
        % this gives us all p4 fixations for the current subject
        subjectp4 = subjectFixations(subjectFixations.TrialPhase == 4, :);
        
        % and this goes through all the short trials and picks fixations
        % from there
        for j = 1:length(trials)
            short = subjectp4.funcRelevance(subjectp4.TrialID == trials(j));
